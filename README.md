GROCERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SYBCA (SECOND YEAR OF BCA FOURTH SEM PROJECT)

E-CART is an online shopping platform that provides users with an easy and convenient way to purchase a variety of daily use products. The platform is built using a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4.6, jQuery, JavaScript, and font-awesome, and is supported by a MySQL database backend.

With E-CART, users can browse and purchase products, view their purchase history and order details, manage their shopping cart, and update their user profile. The platform provides a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and allows for seamless shopping experiences.

Using PHP, E-CART retrieves product information from the MySQL database and dynamically generates product pages that display details, images, and pricing information. The platform also features a shopping cart that users can use to add products and keep track of their order total.

To complete a purchase, users can proceed to the checkout page, where they can enter their billing and shipping information and securely process their payment using PHP. Once the transaction is complete, E-CART updates the MySQL database with the purchase details.

E-CART also features a user profile page that displays the user's personal information and purchase history. This allows users to easily view their order history and track their current orders.

To ensure the security of user information and prevent unauthorized access, E-CART implements robust security measures using PHP. This includes user authentication and validation to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

Overall, E-CART provides users with a reliable and convenient online shopping platform that is easy to use and features robust security measures to protect user information.
